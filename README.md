# ERC1155 with EIP2981 royalties

### Overview

This repo contains [OpenZeppelin's](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) standard [ERC 1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) contracts, slightly modified with (1) the [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) royalties standard and (2) additions for OpenSea like [whitelisting and meta-transactions](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/polygon-basic-integration) to reduce trading friction on Polygon, an [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)-like token metadata, and [contract-level metadata](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata), which collectively streamline listing.

### Why use this repo?

You're looking to create a semi-fungible NFT series that's forward-compatible with EIP 2981 and allows for easy OpenSea import.

**Semi-fungible**: ERC 1155's semi-fungible standard refers to a collection that consists of non-fungible tokens, each with multiple fungible editions. For instance, the ParkPics collection featured as an example in this repository includes 14 non-fungible tokens, each of which can be minted up to 10 times in identical (or fungible) editions.

**EIP 2981**: As of January 2022, Ethereum and Polygon NFT royalties are set by exchanges, which makes royalty enforcement challenging. EIP 2981 is a royalty standard that will likely be implemented across NFT exchanges in the near future. The standard's `royaltyInfo` function returns a public address for the intended royalty recipient and a royalty amount in the sale currency. An exchange would query the function with the NFT's `tokenId` and sale price, and then remit royalties accordingly. Note: the royalty payment isn't built into the contract's transfer functions, so we'd still rely on exchanges to certain extent.

**Easy OpenSea import**: If you're looking to list on OpenSea, they recommend a few additions to the OpenZeppelin standard contracts to streamline integration. Whitelisting the OpenSea proxy contract address enables NFT buyers to list on OpenSea without paying gas fees. Meta-transactions via `ContextMixin` enable gasless user transactions. An override of the `uri` function (metadata) ensures OpenSea correctly caches NFT metadata and images without needing to rely on the standard ERC1155 id substitution format. Contract-level metadata pre-populates basic information about the collection upon import.

### High-level instructions

1) **Upload/pin token metadata through a decentralized service**. We use IPFS and Filecoin in this repo, but you can use other alternatives like Arweave.
2) **Adjust and/or update the smart contracts for your project's needs**. If you're just looking to test deployment, you can use the contracts in this repo as-is and experiment using the ParkPics metadata and images.
3) **Deploy your contract to a testnet, then mainnet for any EVM blockchain**. We'll explain steps for Remix (easiest) and Hardhat (most robust), but you can also use Truffle (java-based) or Brownie (python-based) for deployment.
4) **Verify your contract on the applicable block explorer**. We'll show you how to verify contracts using HardHat, one easy option for verification.
5) **Import your contract to OpenSea**. Once your contract is deployed and verified, you can quickly import to OpenSea via [Get Listed](https://opensea.io/get-listed). You just need the contract address, which you can copy from the block explorer. You'll also need to sign into OpenSea with the contract's owner address before adjusting collection information.

### OpenZeppelin Wizard

We started with the [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) to create the base ERC1155 contracts.
* **Functions**: Mintable and Pausable (allows for owner minting and contract pausing, in the extent something goes wrong)
* **Access Control**: Ownable (one account can mint, pause, etc., versus segregated permissions for multiple accounts)

If you'd like to change these presets, it's probably easiest to start with the [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard), download your new contracts, and then manually incorporate EIP 2981 royalties and the OpenSea-specific changes, as documented below.

### EIP 2981 royalties

EIP 2981 includes two key functions: `royaltyInfo` and `supportsInterface`. In addition to those functions, we implemented the ability to change the royalty recipient. To remove that flexibility, replace `_recipient` with the desired recipient public address.

All EIP 2981 required functions were implemented in the token contract, `ParkPics.sol` in this example.

**Import the EIP 2981 interface in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
import "./@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC2981.sol";
```

Best practice with any standard implementation is to start with an interface. The `IERC2981.sol` `royaltyInfo` function is then overriden in `ParkPics.sol` (see below).

**royaltyInfo function in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
function royaltyInfo(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _salePrice) external view override
        returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount)
    {
        return (_recipient, (_salePrice * 1000) / 10000);
    }
```

When called, this function returns royalty recipient and amount, indifferent to the sale currency. Over time, we expect reputable NFT exchanges will implement this standard, although as of January 2022, most do not.

Note: royalties are not built into the contract's `transfer` functions, which do not include a sale price. Instead, the NFT owner delegates the ability to transfer to exchanges via the `setApprovalForAll` function in `ERC1155.sol`, then the exchange initiates (1) a token transfer once the listing price is fulfilled and (2) royalty payout, which currently is based on information provided to each exchange individually (for OpenSea, the contract owner will populate royalty recipient and amount when updating collection information on OpenSea).

Reputable exchanges tend to follow community standards, which we expect EIP 2981 to become in the near future. Hence, including the functions for forward-compatibility.

**supportsInterface override in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        override(ERC1155, IERC165)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return (
            interfaceId == type(IERC2981).interfaceId ||
            super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)
        );
    }
 ```

This function signals that the contract is compatible with EIP 2981, in addition to ERC 1155 and ERC 165 (via `super`).

**Optional functions to maintain flexibilty to change recipient in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
address private _recipient;

...

constructor() ERC1155("") {
        ...
        _recipient = owner();
    }

...

function _setRoyalties(address newRecipient) internal {
        require(newRecipient != address(0), "Royalties: new recipient is the zero address");
        _recipient = newRecipient;
    }

function setRoyalties(address newRecipient) external onlyOwner {
        _setRoyalties(newRecipient);
    }
```

These additions create a private varible for royalty recipient address, define that address as the contract owner in the constructor, and create an `onlyOwner` function to update the recipient in the future. If you don't need this flexibility, feel free to delete the variable, contructor definition, and functions, and replace `_recipient` in the `royaltyInfo` function with a static public address for the intended recipient.

### OpenSea-specific changes

The OpenSea additions supplement with contracts with whitelisting, meta-transactions, token metadata override, and contract-level metadata.

**Whitelisting in `ERC1155.sol`**:
```
function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
        /** @dev OpenSea whitelisting. */
        if(operator == address(0x207Fa8Df3a17D96Ca7EA4f2893fcdCb78a304101)){
            return true;
        }
        /** @dev Standard ERC1155 approvals. */ 
        return _operatorApprovals[account][operator];
    }
```

The `if` addition above automatically approves a token owner's listing on OpenSea without needing to pay addition gas fees.

**Meta-transactions in `ParkPics.sol` and import of `ContextMixin.sol`**:
```
import "./@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ContextMixin.sol";
...
function _msgSender() internal override view returns (address) {
        return ContextMixin.msgSender();
    }
```

After adding `ContextMixin.sol` to `contract/utils`, we import and add a function to override `_msgSender`. Learn more from [OpenSea](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/polygon-basic-integration) about gas-less transactions.

**Token metadata pin and `PermanentURI` event in `ERC1155.sol`**:
```
import "../../utils/Strings.sol";
...
using Strings for uint256;
string internal _uriBase;
event PermanentURI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id);
...
constructor(string memory uri_) {
        ...
        // Set metadata pin for uri override and permanentURI events
        _uriBase = "ipfs://bafybeigdxgxot7y4a7nygp3j7y2rjtryvrznzgen637jgdd4dxitymdfhi/"; // IPFS for ParkPics collection
        // Set maximum editions per token
        _editionLimit = 10;
    }
...
function _mint(...) ... {
        ...
        // Caps per token supply to 10 editions
        require((_globalEditions[id] + amount) <= _editionLimit, "ERC1155: exceeded token maximum editions");
        ...
        // Tracks number of editions per token
        _globalEditions[id] += amount;
        ...
        // Signals frozen metadata to OpenSea
        emit PermanentURI(string(abi.encodePacked(_uriBase, Strings.toString(id), ".json")), id);
        ...
    }
...
function _mintBatch(...) ... {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            // Caps per token supply to 10 editions
            require((_globalEditions[ids[i]] + amounts[i]) <= _editionLimit, "ERC1155: exceeded token maximum editions");
            ...
            // Tracks number of editions per token
            _globalEditions[ids[i]] += amounts[i];
            ...
            // Signals frozen metadata for OpenSea
            emit PermanentURI(string(abi.encodePacked(_uriBase, Strings.toString(ids[i]), ".json")), ids[i]);
        }
    ...
    }
```

**Token metadata override in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
function uri(uint256 tokenId) override public view returns (string memory) {
        require(tokenId >= 1 && tokenId <= total_supply, "ERC1155Metadata: URI query for nonexistent token");
        return string(abi.encodePacked(_uriBase, Strings.toString(tokenId), ".json"));
    }
```

**Contract-level metadata in `ParkPics.sol`**:
```
string public name;
string public symbol;
uint256 public total_supply;

constructor() ERC1155("") {
        name = "Park Pics";
        symbol = "PPS";
        total_supply = 14;
        ...
    }
...
function contractURI() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "ipfs://bafkreidei44j7z6rifokz5ln6cjleds34ropqyryw4nlxip3g536slisgu";
